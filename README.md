# Prusa i3 Beer Upgrade
The project is inspired by @gregsun and his great work https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade :

"The Beer Upgrade replaces the original Prusa i3 MK3S (...) frame with a more rigid and reliable solution. It allows faster prints, increases precision, makes maintenance easier and opens the door to more customization. Plus it looks unique with our coloured frames!"

The Beer Upgrade does the same but cheaper, like four beers and looks even more cool.
